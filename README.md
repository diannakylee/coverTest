Cover Hacker Rank Test

- Price Matching Question
- Two Array Comparison 
- ToDo List - remove list item

All three answers are in the app.js file, but the first two are also separated into individual files (price.js and arrays.js).

For the toDo list piece, I couldn't figure out how to work in the Node.js environment on hacker rank.  I spent some time reviewing the various js files but I wasn't able to familiarize myself enough to make it work (look forward to learning it though!).  I downloaded the files during the test and replicated the core functions (add item, and remove item) using jQuery.
